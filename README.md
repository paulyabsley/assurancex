You should then show the resulting yearly premium and allow them to pay by PayPal.

The Premium

To calculate the premium find a way to check the crime level in their postcode

(http://data.police.uk/docs/). The premium should be calculated as: (total number of crimes in the

postcode) * (Bike Market Value / 20) * (type of cover)

the process.

create the homepage but use it as a guide for the look and feel for the web pages you do create.
